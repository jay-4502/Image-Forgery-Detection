# Image Forgery Detection using ELA(Error Level Analysis)

Image forging is the manipulation of digital images using methods like copy-move, splicing, image removal etc. Image forgery detection is the process of identifying
a modified image from the original. In the realm of digital image processing, image forgery detection is a critical task. The amount of altered and faked photographs 
has increased as digital imaging has become more prevalent and is used in a variety of fields, including forensics, media, and scientific study. They must guard the 
veracity of photos and stop the dissemination of false information and fake news.

The method used in this paper combines a error level analysis (ELA) and convolution neural network (CNN). ELA is a widely used method for locating altered areas of an image  based on variations in the error levels brought on by compression. On the other hand, CNNs have great feature extraction capabilities for image analysis.
ELA is a forensic method for examining photos at various levels of compression. It is predicated on the idea that a picture's compression level is not
constant, and that portions that have undergone modification will have a different compression level than the remainder of the image. The original
image and a compressed version of the same image are compared by ELA to determine how well it performs. CNN's underlying idea is convolution, which involves combining several
filters with the input image in order to extract features. The image is then classified using the retrieved features.
